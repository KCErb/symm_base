module SymmBase
  # Provides a common type for [isometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry).
  #
  # You can turn your class into an Isometry like so:
  #
  # ```
  # class MyIsometry
  #   include SymmBase::Isometry
  #
  #   def initialize
  #     @kind = :my_isometry
  #   end
  #
  #   def transform(point)
  #     # Do something to the point, or not, up to you.
  #     # Just be sure to return a point when you're done
  #   end
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # At the moment, this base module just requires that you give a transform
  # method and initialize the `@kind` variable. There is no actual enforcement
  # that the transform method preserves any metrics.

    # Transforms a `Set` of points according to the class's
    # `transform` method.
    def transform(points : Set(Point))
      points.map { |point| transform(point) }.to_set
    end

    # must also support transforming anything with 3 vals in an array that respond
    # to plus, times, minus etc... but I don't know how to enforce that cleanly here
    abstract def transform(vectorlike : Vectorlike) : Vectorlike

    # allow to pass symbols corresponding to `point` having an `invert(symbol)` for vectorlike input
    # in that case it's the point's job to allow multiple symbols
    # so in the vectorlike case, we have to pass along potentially many symbols
    def transform(vectorlike : Vectorlike, invert = [] of Symbol) : Vectorlike
